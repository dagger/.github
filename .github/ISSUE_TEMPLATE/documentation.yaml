        This template is strictly used for documentation requests, including:

        - Documenting undocumented APIs;
        - Elaborating on a particular topic;
        - Updating external links;
        - anything else that doesn't require code changes.

        If you followed the documentation but things don't work, was it the docs or the code?
        If the code was wrong, please file a bug report instead - link is above.

        Before you go ahead, please check if this documentation issue has [already been reported](./).
